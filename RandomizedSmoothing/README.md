# Breaking Ramdomized Gaussian Smoothing

In this repo, we provide out implementation for attacking the [Certifiable Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02918). 
We would like to note that most of this implementation is based on their [official implementation for Randomized Gaussian Smoothing](https://github.com/locuslab/smoothing), so to them, we give the credit.
